Awesome that you are reading this!

The goal of this repository is to show my handcrafted
staircase cards.

with a preference to accept suggestions.

  Whatever these are, these are created when clicking the 'Edit page' icon
  located at the top-right of each page.

???- question "Where is the 'Edit page' icon?"

    The 'Edit page' icon is
    located at the top-right of each page.
